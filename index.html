    Hello world


<p>
You're not your job.
You're not how much money you make in the bank.
You're not the car you drive.
You're not the content of your wallet.
You're not your khakis.
You're not the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.

<p>As Lincoln said in his famous Gettysburg Address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
